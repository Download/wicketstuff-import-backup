      <span wicket:id="message">
        The site has been running on the new server for over two weeks and it's working great! The new server is fast and I especially love the new feature that allows me to control (start/stop/reload) this sites' Tomcat context. 
        Thank you <a href="/eclipse/redirecturl_do.jsp?id=1" target="javaservlethosting">JavaServletHosting.com</a> people!
