  The purpose of this library is to provide a uniform API for managing
  the lifecycle of POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) which are stored somehow
  in a database.
  <p/>
  A small, extensible SPI (Service Provider Interface) is 
  provided for implementing storing and querying for objects.
  <p/>
  POJOs are accessed through <a href="PersistenceFacade.html">persistence
  facades</a>.  A persistence facade is an object which manages the lifecycle
  of one POJO - fetching it from a database, saving it back to the database,
  marking it modified, etc.
  <p/>
  In particular, <code>PersistenceFacade</code>s are useful for memory
  management - a <code>PersistenceFacade</code> is a serializable object which
  can be hibernated into a state where it is only retaining an id for an
  object in the database, not the object itself.  This is particularly useful
  for frameworks like Wicket which serialize objects for session replication - 
  this library makes it easy to serialize only an object's ID, not the object
  itself, and resolve it on demand.
  <p/>
  This library does not attempt to do anything magical with dynamic proxies
  or similar - does not automatically attach listeners to objects or similar.
  Libraries that build on it certainly may.  It simply attempts to solve the
  problem of managing persistent object lifecycle, not hide the complexity
  of doing that.  So,
  if you modify an object retrieved from the database, you need to 
  call <code>modified()</code> on its <code>PersistenceFacade</code>.  Higher
  level libraries can do this sort of magic - as does the implementation
  of <a href="http://wicket.apache.org">Wicket models</a> over this library.
  <p/>
  In order to use this library, you need an implementation of its SPI 
  available, such as the db4o implementation.  Other implementations are
  possible - for example over hibernate, or even using straight JDBC.  There
  are two interfaces to implement to implement this library over a different
  kind of database.  See the <a href="spi/package-summary.html">SPI Documentation</a>
  for further details.
  <p/>
  To get a <code>PersistenceFacade</code> for an object, simply call
  <pre>
      someDatabase.getPersistenceFactory().*
  </pre>
  There are a variety of methods on FacadeFactory for querying the database,
  creating new objects, etc...
