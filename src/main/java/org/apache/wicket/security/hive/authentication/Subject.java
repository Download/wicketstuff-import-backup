/**
 * Subject represents (part of) an authenticated entity. It can be decorated
 * with certain rights ({@link Principal}s). Most implementations will provide
 * some means to add (and sometimes remove) principals, however all must honor
 * the readonly flag. {@link #setReadOnly()} is automatically triggerd after a
 * login. Subjects are created by {@link LoginContext}s as placeholders for the
 * rights of a user for the duration of the session. In addition Subjects play
 * an importeand part in multi-login scenario's as they define what they
 * authenticate. For example one subject might authenticate all subclassses of
 * BasicSecurePage where another might authenicate all subclasses of
 * AdvancedSecurePage. Effectivly requiring a use to login twice if both type of
 * pages are to be visited.
