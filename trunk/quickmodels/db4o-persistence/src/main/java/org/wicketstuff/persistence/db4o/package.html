        This library implements the Persistence Facade library's database interface
        over the db4o object database.
        <p/>
        The db4o implementation defines an API of two additional interfaces which
        applications may use to access db4o-specific functionality:  
        <ul>
            <li><code><a href="Backup.html">Backup</a></code> - back up the database
            to another file on disk</li>
            <li><code><a href="Defrag.html">Defrag</a></code> - accesses db4o's 
            defragmentation facility</li>
        </ul>
        To create and start using a database, create an instance of the
        Db class over db4o as follows:
        <pre>
            Db database = Db4oDb.create ("path/to/database/file");
        </pre>
        <p/>
        <b>Licensing:</b> This library is dual licensed for license-compatibility with
        db4o's GPL and commercial licensing.  If you obtained your copy of db4o under
        the Gnu Public License, then that license governs your use of this library.
        If you obtained your copy of db4o under a commercial, non-GPL license, then
        the Apache license applies to your use of this code.
