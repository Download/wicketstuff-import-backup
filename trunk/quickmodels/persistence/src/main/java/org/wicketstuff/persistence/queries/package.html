      This package contains the API for <i>complex queries</i> of
      persistent objects.  The primary interface for a complex
      query is the <a href="QueryElement.html">QueryElement</a>
      interface.  It is passed to <a href="../FacadeFactory.html">FacadeFactory.forComplexQuery()</a> 
      or similar methods on <a href="../spi/PersistenceUtils.html">PersistenceUtils</a>
      (or if you are using the Quick Models library for Wicket, you
      pass it to 
      <code>Queries.COMPLEX.builder([type]).setObject()</code>).
      <p/>
      <a href="FieldElementQuery.html">FieldElementQuery</a> lets you
      specify a value to match against for a specific field on a
      specific type.  The <code>and()</code> and <code>or()</code>
      methods let you combine these into compound queries - 
      represented by the class <a href="CompoundQueryElement.html">CompoundQueryElement</a>.
      You can also create trees of queries (think of CompoundQueryElement
      as a set of parentheses) using <code>CompoundQueryElement.create()</code>.
