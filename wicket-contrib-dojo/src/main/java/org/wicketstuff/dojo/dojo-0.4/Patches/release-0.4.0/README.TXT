subject 	: subject of the patch or patched file name
trackNumber	: trackNumber in the dojo tracker : http://trac.dojotoolkit.org/

#=============================================================================#
# Following patches have to be applied on a 0.4.1 dojo release even if for    #
# for the moment, dojo embedded in wicketstuff.dojo is Dojo 0.4.0             #
# See http://81.17.46.170:8090/jira/browse/DOJO-65                            #
