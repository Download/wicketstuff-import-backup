/**
 * A service providing channel based communication facility in wicket based applications.
 * <p>
 * Implementation of this interface are the basis of a channel based communication implementation.
 * You usually store one IChannelService implementation in your application instance,
 * and then delegate all your channel related operations to this service, 
 * allowing very easy switching between channel communication implementations.
 * <p>
 * Here is how you usually use an IChannelService implementation:
 * <pre>
 *  IChannelService channelService = MyApplication.get().getChannelService();
 * 	// I want to send an event when i click a button
 *  [...]
 *  	onClick(AjaxRequestTarget target){
 *  		channelService.publish(new ChannelEvent("channel"));
 *  	}
 *  [...]
 *  
 *  // All pages listening this event should add
 *  [...]
 *  	channelService.addChannelListener(this, "channel", new IChannelListener() {
 *  		public void onEvent(String channel, Map datas, IChannelTarget target){
        		target.[...]
        	}
 *  	});
 *  [...]
 * </pre> 
 *
