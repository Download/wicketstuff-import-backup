<body>

This is an example of the DataTable Autocomplete.  Here we have loaded <span wicket:id="numberOfMethods"/> methods from the <b>rt.jar</b> of the JVM that is running this application.
A Patricia Trie is used as the index so that this search field will work fast using AJAX to look up any element.

<br/>

Below you will find a listing of the size of each subtree based on the first character of the string.


<p/>
<form wicket:id="settingsForm">
Match Mode: <select wicket:id="findMethod"></select>
Class Name Filter: <input type="text" wicket:id="filter"></input>
</form>
<br/>
Search: <span wicket:id="field" /><br/>
Selected: <span wicket:id="selectedMethod" />
<p/>

<span wicket:id="alphabetFrequency"/>
