<p>KRONOS (or Cronus) was the Titan god of time and the ages, especially
time where regarded as destructive and all-devouring. He ruled the
cosmos during the so-called Golden Age, after castrating and deposing
his own father Ouranos (the Sky) from the throne. In fear of a prophecy
that he would be in turn be overthrown by his own son, Kronos swallowed
each of his children as soon as they were born. Rhea managed to save the
youngest, Zeus, by hiding him away on the island of Krete, and fed
Kronos a stone wrapped in the swaddling clothes of an infant. The god
grew up, forced Kronos to disgorge his swallowed offspring, and led the
Olympians in a ten year war against the Titanes, before driving them
defeated into the pit of Tartaros. Many human generations later, Zeus
released Kronos and his brothers from this prison, and made the old
Titan king of the Elysian Islands, home of the blessed dead. Kronos was
essentially the same as Khronos, the primeval god of time who appears in
the Orphic traditions.</p>
