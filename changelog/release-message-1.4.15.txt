Hello, 

Following the release of wicket 1.4.15 I've cut a matching release for wicketstuff-core.

The artifacts have been promoted and synced into the maven central repository.

They can be retrieved like this:

<dependency>
<groupId>org.wicketstuff</groupId>
<artifactId>some recently changed artifact</artifactId>
<version>1.4.15</version>
</dependency>

The release tag is here: https://wicket-stuff.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/wicket-stuff/tags/wicketstuff-core-1.4.15

The new 1.4.15.1-SNAPSHOT stable branch is here: https://wicket-stuff.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/wicket-stuff/branches/wicketstuff-core-1.4.15

Release Notes - WicketStuff Core - Version 1.4.15:

<artifactId>:
<list of key changes or bugfixes included in this release>

wicket-shiro:
	- org.wicketstuff.shiro.component.LoginPanel$SignInForm now extends StatelessForm instead of Form
	- org.wicketstuff.shiro.component.LoginPanel.onSignInSucceeded now redirects to homepage using
			setResponsePage(getApplication().getHomePage()) 
		instead of
		    setResponsePage(getApplication().getSessionSettings().getPageFactory().newPage(getApplication().getHomePage()))
		    

The plan is to release a 1.4.15.1 point release within one month from today.    If you commit code and/or want a release sooner let me know as one month is the worst case target.

Regards, 

WicketStuff release developer
