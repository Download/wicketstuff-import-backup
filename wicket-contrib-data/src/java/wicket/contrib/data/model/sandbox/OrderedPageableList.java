/**
 * A List that behaves like a pageable object. It works with a count and a
 * window. The count is used for the total number of elements that are available
 * for this list, and the window is used for the currently loaded elements.
 * <p>
 * This list figures out what elements need to be loaded when asked for
 * elements. The actual loading of the count and elements is delegated to
 * subclasses. Ordering is supported through the add/remove ordering methods.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Detachable operation is supported by {@link #getDetachableModel()}, however,
 * for expensive queries (such as search) it may be advisable to set the window
 * several times larger than the paging size and not use detaching so that the
 * search is rerun less often. Also note tha this class is most efficient when
 * it's window size is exactly that of the page containing it, however it's best
 * to overestimate: a window one item smaller than the page will result in two
 * selects for each request.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Not all {@link java.util.List}methods are supported. Unsupported methods
 * will throw {@link java.lang.IllegalStateException}s.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * NOTE: this list is meant for specific situations, like backing up
 * {@link wicket.markup.html.list.PageableListView}s, that use sequential
 * addressing of the list. Random access is inefficient, as a number of rows
 * (the page) is loaded at once for each window. Hence it IS efficent for
 * sequential access.
