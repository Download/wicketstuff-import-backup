			<subsection name="January 4, 2006 - DojoAutoUpdateHandler, try it now!">
				<p>
					We have just finished our latest component. It is an Ajax auto update handler. Since it uses Wicket's beta functionality to render a singel component, you can currently only use it with the HEAD version of Wicket.
					You can find the components when you checkout wicket-contrib-dojo from CVS.
					We've included a tutorial in our tutorial section which should get you started right away!
