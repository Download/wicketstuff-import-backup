		<section name="Welcome to Wicket Stuff">
			<p>
				The Wicket Stuff project provides additional Java web components to the core 
				components supplied by the <a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net">Wicket</a> 
				framework. Components offered by this project include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Hibernate (2.1 and 3) components</li>
				<li>fValidate integration</li>
				<li>Spring integration components</li>
				<li>Groovy integration components</li>
				<li>Velocity Panel</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net">Wicket</a> is a Java web application 
				framework that takes simplicity, separation of concerns and ease of development
				to a whole new level.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Wicket Stuff project provides non-core components to the Wicket project. By
				non-core we mean that the Wicket project should focus on being a very focussed
				framework, not distracted by development of other frameworks, such as 
				<a href="http://www.hibernate.org">Hibernate</a> or 
				<a href="http://www.springframework.com">Spring</a>. This enables the core developers
				to focus on creating a first class framework, and the other developers to create many
				components, that the core couldn't foresee to maintain.
