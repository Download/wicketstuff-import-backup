This is a benchmark application for testing Wicket and possibly other frameworks, such as Tapestry. The idea is to have a simple application and run a jmeter script against it simulating 50 or 100 users pounding at the application.

The application requires JDK-1.5 or newer (because the source of the application contains some Java 5 specifics).

The application contains a Start.java file which will run the application using an embedded Jetty instance.

This application has support for both Wicket 1.2 and 1.3, however they can't run at the same time in the same server. You must only have one Wicket jar in the classpath during testing. This will generate compile errors in Eclipse, but that does not affect runtime performance, as long as you don't hit those pages.

To switch between wicket 1.2 and 1.3 you need to remove the not used Wicket library from the classpath and you need to modify the web.xml file to exclude the offending servlet.

This distribution contains a jmeter test script for fun and games, it is located in:

src/jmeter

Have fun!
