/**
 * An Dojo behavior that is attached to a certain client-side (usually
 * javascript) event, such as onClick, onChange, onKeyDown, etc.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *       DropDownChoice choice=new DropDownChoice(...);
 *       choice.add(new DojoEventBehavior(&quot;onchange&quot;) {
 *           protected void onEvent(AjaxRequestTarget target) {
 *               System.out.println(&quot;ajax here!&quot;);
 *           }
 *       }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * This behavior will be linked to the onChange javascript event of the select
 * box this DropDownChoice represents, and so anytime a new option is selected
 * we will get the System.out message
