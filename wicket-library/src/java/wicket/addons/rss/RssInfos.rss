      <title>Flow4J</title>
			<description>&lt;font style=&#034;color:#DD00AA&#034;&gt;Version 0.9.4 for Eclipse 2.1.* and 3.*&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Flow4J is a plugin for the eclipse IDE that enables the modelling of process flows in a drag and drop manner. Building a Flow4J project creates the flow&#039;s java source code which is then compiled by the JDT plugin. Process steps, called flowlets, can be written in java and placed in the Flow4J project. The Plug-in uses the eclipse-gef framework.
