    <h3>Advanced example</h3>
    This page shows a more complex usage of TinyMCE. On this page the mode is set to convert specific elements in this
    case a DIV element and a TEXTAREA into editor instances. The example below uses a custom CSS, thats why the text is
    red and it allso uses the "advanced" theme that includes more options than the default one. The code allso includes
    examples of custom call back functions and much more. Notice the submit button at the end of the page, this button
    triggers a save action. Read more about the features and possible settings of TinyMCE in the manual.<br/><br/>
