---------------- Wazzit ----------------

Initial project for Wicket Seam support. Currently hosts the integration code (which
due to Igor's and Al's great work on Spring and Guice isn't too much) and a simple example
that nevertheless shows off that Seam can do scoped DI.

It's a start, and I can imagine that there are quite a few issues and features that can be
worked on. Anyone interested in working on this project, please drop us a line.

The plan is to keep it as Wicket stuff project for a while to play around with, and if licensing
 issues are resolved, Seams has a decent and recent maven deployment and hopefully 
 a *much leaner* version (currently we'd need all the JSF, Hibernate JEE dependencies 
 just to get it running) we can consider migrating this to a core project. Otoh, it might 
 be a project with many interested people, in which case it'd actually better stay here.
 
I think the most interesting features to look at first are related to JPA/ Hibernate ORM and
validation support and transaction stuff. Next on my list would be jBPM (might be nice
for wizard building) and possibly Seam's rule engine integration for authorization. On the
longer term, we should keep an eye on WebBeans.

---------------- Setting it up ----------------

Check out this project from http://wicket-stuff.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/wicket-stuff/trunk/wicket-seam-test, 
and check out and build Seam from anoncvs.forge.jboss.com, repo '/cvsroot/jboss', module 'jboss-seam'
using mvn clean install to install it in your local maven repository. You can then build this project as you like, 
or just check it out with the Eclipse project definitions directly.

---------------- Starting the example ----------------

Find your Jetty starter class in src/test. The difference with the usual Jetty starter is that this 
one uses Jetty plus, which has some support for JNDI etc. Unfortunately, at this time Seam won't start 
without such support. Of course, it should run excellent on JBoss :)

Supply -Dwicket.configuration=development as a VM argument if you want to play around and turn
on template reloading.
