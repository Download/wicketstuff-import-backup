    <h2>What is Wicket?</h2>
    Wicket is a Java web application framework that takes simplicity, separation of concerns and ease 
    of development to a whole new level. Wicket pages can be mocked up, previewed and later revised 
    using standard WYSIWYG HTML design tools. Dynamic content processing and form handling is all 
    handled in Java code using a first-class component model backed by POJO data beans that can easily 
    be persisted using your favourite technology.
