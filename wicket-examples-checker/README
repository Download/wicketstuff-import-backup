Running 'mvn clean test' will execute the test against http://localhost:8080/wicket-examples (this is the default location if wicket-examples is started with mvn jetty:run).

To execute the test against different URL:
$ MAVEN_OPTS="-Dchecker.host=wicketstuff.org -Dchecker.port=80 -Dchecker.context=wicket14" mvn clean test
