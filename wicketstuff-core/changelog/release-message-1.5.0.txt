Release Notes - WicketStuff Core - Version 1.5.0:

<artifactId>:
<list of key changes or bugfixes included in this release>

gae-initializer:
A new project in WicketStuff family.
Putting gae-initializer.jar in the classpath of your application will automatically configure it so that it can run in Google AppEngine.
The configuration includes:
 - disable the resource polling
 - set IObjectStreamFactory which doesn't extend Object(Input|Output)Streams
 - set HttpSessionDataStore as a storage for the page history

The plan is to release a 1.5.0.1 point release within one month from today.    If you commit code and/or want a release sooner let me know as one month is the worst case target.

Regards, 

WicketStuff release developer
