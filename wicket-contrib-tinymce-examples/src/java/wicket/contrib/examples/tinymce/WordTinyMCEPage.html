    <h3>Word example</h3>
    This example shows you how TinyMCE can be configurated to function with Word content in the best possible way.
    TinyMCE is configured to auto convert/cleanup pasted Word content in this example. It's has also a custom CSS that
    makes paragraphs marginless as in Word.<br/><br/>

    <textarea wicket:id="ta" id="ta" name="ta" rows="30" style="width: 100%">
        Some &lt;b&gt;element&lt;/b&gt;, this is to be editor 1.
