Important:

This could be your starting point of using client-side validation.
However, as it is something that I don't use myself, it is currently
not be supported. I am more in favor of the ajax approach for this
kind of functionalitity.

If you have serious plans of using this, and want to help supporting
this project, please send me or on of the mailing lists an email. Or otherwise
just copy and paste for your own needs.

Things to be improved:
* create a form adapter (for stuff like onsubmit="return validateForm(this, false, false, false, true, 16);")
* better localization support
* more/ better checks (like dates... they are hard to get right because of the mismatch between java and javascript)
* use header contribution support of Wicket 1.1 to automatically include the needed javascripts.
